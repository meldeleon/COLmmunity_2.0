## Dev notes

1. Please note that the current version 1.0.0 relies entirely on app cache and has no persistent database. There does exist a file for db.js that contains dynamoDB methods and pushes the items that exist in app cache to a DB. We plan to move from app cache to a cloud-based DB at a future version.

## STUFF TO DO:

1. ~~Add /assign_commander function~~
1. Add commander to /print_faction function
1. Add /reset command to reset all factions and flip all currently queued users to off.
1. Add /clear_queue command to flip all currently queued users to off.
1. Add /start command to locks faction assignments, flips users in queue to false, assigns faction roles, sends out voice invites, increment the number of games played per assigned user.

## KNOWN BUGS

1. When a user queues, but leaves the discord server before role assignment, role assigment fails.
